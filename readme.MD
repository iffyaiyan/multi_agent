# Agent-based Language Model System

This system uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to create an agent-based approach for completing complex tasks. It breaks down tasks, assigns them to specialized workers, and aggregates the results.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install openai
   ```
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Running the System

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the task you want to complete when prompted.
3. The system will analyze the task, create workers, break it down into subtasks, and execute them.
4. The final output will be displayed in the console.

## System Structure

- `AgentSystem`: The main class that orchestrates the entire process.
- `Worker`: Represents individual workers with specific roles and responsibilities.

## Key Functions

- `analyze_task`: Determines the necessary roles for a given task.
- `create_workers`: Instantiates worker objects based on the analyzed roles.
- `execute_task`: The main function that runs the entire task completion process.
- `break_down_task`: Divides the main task into subtasks.
- `assign_subtask`: Assigns each subtask to the most appropriate worker.
- `share_knowledge`: Allows workers to share information.
- `aggregate_results`: Combines the results from all workers into a final output.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- The system currently uses GPT-3.5-turbo for all operations. Future versions could use different models for different tasks.
- Error handling could be improved to make the system more robust.
- The system could benefit from a more sophisticated method of inter-worker communication.
- Implementing a caching mechanism could improve efficiency for repetitive tasks.

## Note

This system makes multiple API calls to OpenAI, which may incur costs. Please be aware of your usage and any associated fees.
